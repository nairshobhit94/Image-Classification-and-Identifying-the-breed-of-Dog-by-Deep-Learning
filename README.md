Image classification and Identifying the dog breed by using Convolutional Neural Network with the help of Deep Learning

The ResNet50 is a convolutional neural network hat is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images.

The Accuracy is almost 96% in predicting the breed of Dog.
